<form action="numbers.php" method="get">
Luku: <input TYPE="text" name="num"><br>
<input type="submit" value="Send">     
</form>

<!-- 
INSTRUCTIONS:
Create a PHP script which prints numbers starting from the one 
input on the form, down till zero. The numbers should be 
separated by spaces, but there shouldn't be a space after the 
last number (the zero, that is). If the input value is less 
than zero, print the text "The number has to be at least zero!". 

EXAMPLE OUTPUT:
The absolute value of -3 is 3
